          <p>Hi! My name is Eric Noll and I am a junior developer.</p>
          <p>
            I was raised in Cincinnati, OH and went to Ball State University to
            study music in Muncie, IN. After living in Indianapolis, I moved to
            Washington, DC with my current partner. After 3 years we decided to
            moved to our current home in Chicago, IL where I currently work at
            Northwestern University as a Talent Acquisition Partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working as a Human Resources professional, I enjoy
            spending time with my husband of 2 years and our cat and golden
            retriever. I love playing video games, finding ways to stay fit,
            cooking (and subsequently eating) delicious food, and playing
            intermural sports around the Chicago area.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find myself attracted to Information Technology because, for lack
            of a better term, it's the future! I've always been a creative
            person and attracted to different methods of self-expression. With
            IT, I can allow myself to be creative and still stay on top of
            growing trends in the development field.
